# Collection of colour schemes for desktop applications

Welcome to my very personal collection of various colour schemes for terminal windows and other desktop applications.

*Note:* I mix the terms "skin", "scheme" and "theme" because different apps use different terms. In the end, all the terms means the same. ;-)


## Skins for *Midnight Commander*

**Scheme `jd-adwaita-darker`**

This skin is designed to fit the colours of the GNOME theme "Adwaita Dark". Currently, I use the GNOME Terminal with it's default colour palette. I plan to add the palette matching my ["Adwaita Darker" colorschemes](https://github.com/joede/joede-geany-themes) for Geany.

## Theme configuration for *ZIM Desktop Wiki*

This skin is designed to fit the colours of the GNOME theme "Adwaita Dark". I've changed the original configuration file provided by the original Debian packages. It can be found at `/usr/share/zim/style.conf`!
